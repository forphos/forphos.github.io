“Phenomenon-oriented research encompasses various fields and disciplines, where the focus is on studying and understanding specific phenomena.”  

Welcome to the Forum for Research on Phenomenon-Oriented Science, a multidisciplinary and collaborative platform dedicated to the mapping, impact assessment, and analysis of phenomenon-oriented research using computational methods conducted by a group of international researchers. Our mission is to employ these innovative approaches to map and explore the impact and analysis of phenomenon-oriented research across various scientific domains. 

In an era of rapid scientific advancement and interdisciplinary collaboration, understanding and harnessing the power of phenomena play a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge. Our forum serves as a vibrant platform where experts from diverse backgrounds converge to investigate and unravel the intricate nature of phenomena through the lens of bibliographic data. 

At the Forum for Research on Phenomenon-Oriented Science, we recognize the significance of phenomena as fundamental building blocks for understanding the world around us. Our researchers delve into the depths of these phenomena, aiming to unravel their underlying mechanisms, uncover patterns, and decipher their broader implications. By embracing a phenomenon-oriented approach, we bridge disciplinary boundaries and stimulate collaborations that transcend traditional silos of knowledge. 

The primary objectives of our forum are to: 

Map the Landscape: By systematically surveying and mapping the landscape of phenomenon-oriented research, we aim to identify key trends, emerging areas of interest, and gaps in our knowledge. This enables us to foster a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research in this domain. 

Assess Impact: We critically evaluate the impact of phenomenon-oriented research on scientific paradigms, technological advancements, and societal implications. Through rigorous analysis and evaluation, we strive to illuminate the transformative potential of this research approach. 

Foster Collaboration: The Forum for Research on Phenomenon-Oriented Science serves as a collaborative platform, fostering interdisciplinary interactions, promoting knowledge exchange, and nurturing partnerships. We believe that by bringing together diverse perspectives, we can catalyse innovation and foster new synergies that propel the field forward. 

Disseminate Knowledge: We are committed to disseminating the findings and insights generated within our forum to the broader scientific community and society at large. Through publications, conferences, workshops, and public engagement, we strive to communicate the significance and relevance of phenomenon-oriented research.
